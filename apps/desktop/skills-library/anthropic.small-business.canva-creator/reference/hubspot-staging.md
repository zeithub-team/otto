## Tier check

If you're unsure whether the user has Marketing Hub Professional:

```
GET /crm/v3/objects/companies?limit=1
```

Check the `subscriptionType` on the account. If the API returns a 403 on
social endpoints, tell the user: "HubSpot campaign staging requires Marketing
Hub Professional. Your current plan doesn't include it. I can export a
scheduling CSV instead — would that work?"

## Create a campaign

```
POST /marketing/v3/campaigns
{
  "name": "Summer Sale 2026 — Social",
  "startDate": "2026-06-01",
  "endDate":   "2026-06-30",
  "currencyCode": "<Currency from the Business context block, e.g. AUD>",
  "utm": {
    "source": "social",
    "medium": "owned",
    "campaign": "summer-sale-2026"
  }
}
```

Response: `{ "id": "<campaign_id>", ... }` — save this for social post association.

---

## Create a social post

One call per calendar row. Stage as `SCHEDULED`, never `PUBLISHED`.

```
POST /marketing/v3/social/posts
{
  "campaignId": "<campaign_id>",
  "channelId":  "<hubspot_channel_id>",
  "content": {
    "body": "<approved caption text>"
  },
  "scheduledAt": "2026-06-03T10:00:00Z",
  "attachments": [
    {
      "url": "<canva_export_png_url>"
    }
  ],
  "status": "SCHEDULED"
}
```

**`channelId`** — the HubSpot Social account ID (not the platform name).
Retrieve connected accounts:
```
GET /marketing/v3/social/channels
```
Match by `type` (`INSTAGRAM`, `FACEBOOK`, `TWITTER`, `LINKEDIN`) and use the `id` field.

**`scheduledAt`** — must be in the future (relative to the time of the API
call). Use noon local time for the owner's timezone unless they specify
otherwise.

---

## Verify the scheduled queue

After staging all posts:

```
GET /marketing/v3/social/posts?status=SCHEDULED&campaignId=<campaign_id>
```

Surface results in a table: date, channel, first 60 chars of caption, status.
Provide the direct HubSpot campaign URL:
`https://app.hubspot.com/content/{portalId}/social/campaigns/{campaign_id}`

Tell the user: "Posts are scheduled and will publish automatically. You can
cancel or edit any post in HubSpot before the send time."

---

## CSV fallback (non-Professional users)

When HubSpot staging is not available, export a CSV the user can import into
Buffer, Later, or their scheduler of choice.

Column headers:
```
Date,Time,Channel,Caption,ImageURL,Status
```

Example row:
```
2026-06-03,10:00 AM CDT,Instagram,"Summer Sale: 30% off candles ☀️ ...",https://canva.com/export/...,Scheduled
```

Tell the user: "I've prepared a scheduling CSV since your HubSpot plan doesn't
include social staging. You can import this into Buffer or Later. [file path]"
