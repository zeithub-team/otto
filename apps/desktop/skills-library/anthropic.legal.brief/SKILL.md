### Topic Brief

Research and brief on a specific legal question or topic across available sources.

#### Workflow

1. Accept the topic query from the user
2. Search across connected sources:
   - **Documents**: Internal memos, prior analyses, playbooks, precedent
   - **Email**: Prior communications on the topic
   - **Chat**: Team discussions about the topic
   - **CLM**: Related contracts or clauses
3. Synthesize findings into a structured brief

#### Output Format

```
## Topic Brief: [Topic]

### Summary
[2-3 sentence executive summary of findings]

### Background
[Context and history from internal sources]

### Current State
[What the organization's current position or approach is, based on available documents]

### Key Considerations

### Internal Precedent
[Prior decisions, memos, or positions found in internal sources]

### Gaps
[What information is missing or what sources were not available]

### Recommended Next Steps
[What the user should do with this information]
```

#### Important Notes
- Topic briefs synthesize what is available in connected sources; they do not substitute for formal legal research
- If the topic requires current legal authority or case law, recommend the user consult a legal research platform (Westlaw, Lexis, etc.) or outside counsel
- Always note the limitations of the sources searched

---

### Incident Brief

Rapid briefing for developing situations that require immediate legal attention (data breaches, litigation threats, regulatory inquiries, IP disputes, etc.).

#### Workflow

1. Accept the incident topic or description
2. Rapidly scan all connected sources for relevant context:
   - **Email**: Communications about the incident
   - **Chat**: Real-time discussions and escalations
   - **Documents**: Relevant policies, response plans, insurance coverage
   - **Calendar**: Scheduled response meetings
   - **CLM**: Affected contracts, indemnification provisions, insurance requirements
3. Compile into an actionable incident brief

#### Output Format

```
## Incident Brief: [Topic]
**Prepared**: [timestamp]
**Classification**: [severity assessment if determinable]

### Situation Summary
[What is known about the incident]

### Timeline
[Chronological summary of events based on available sources]

### Immediate Legal Considerations
[Regulatory notification requirements, preservation obligations, privilege concerns]

### Relevant Agreements
[Contracts, insurance policies, or other agreements that may be implicated]

### Internal Response
[What response activity has already occurred based on email/chat]

### Key Contacts
[Relevant internal and external contacts identified from sources]

### Recommended Immediate Actions
1. [Most urgent action]
2. [Second priority]
3. [etc.]

### Information Gaps
[What is not yet known and needs to be determined]

### Sources Checked
[What was searched and what was not available]
```

#### Important Notes for Incident Briefs
- Speed matters. Produce the brief quickly with available information rather than waiting for complete information
- Flag any litigation hold or preservation obligations immediately
- Note privilege considerations (mark the brief as attorney-client privileged / work product if appropriate)
- If the incident may involve a data breach, flag applicable notification deadlines (e.g., 72 hours for GDPR)
- Recommend outside counsel engagement if the matter is significant

## General Notes

- If sources are unavailable, note the gaps prominently so the user knows what was not checked
- For daily briefs, learn the user's preferences over time (what they find useful, what they want filtered out)
- Briefs should be actionable: every item should have a clear next step or reason for inclusion
- Keep briefs concise. Link to source materials rather than reproducing them in full
