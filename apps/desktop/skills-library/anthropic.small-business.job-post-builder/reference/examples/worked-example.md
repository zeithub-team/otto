### `Senior-PM-Interview-Guide.docx`

Structure follows `../interview-guide-structure.md`:

- **Role summary** — one paragraph reminding interviewers what they're assessing.
- **Stage map** — 3 stages, each interviewer, each competency.
- **Stage 1: Recruiter screen** — Communication, baseline fit, logistics.
  Questions focus on career narrative and logistics (comp, start date, remote setup).
- **Stage 2: HM deep-dive** — Roadmap ownership, payments context, prioritization
  under constraints. 5–6 behavioral questions; 2–3 follow-up probes each.
- **Stage 3: Senior PM panel** — Split between the two panelists. Panelist A owns
  product judgment (how they make tradeoffs); Panelist B owns cross-functional
  collaboration (how they work with engineering and design). Questions are pre-assigned
  so the candidate isn't asked the same thing twice.
- **Scoring rubric** — 1/3/5 anchors written specifically for a payments PM role
  (not generic). Example for "Ownership": 5 = proactively identified checkout
  failure mode no one asked them to track, drove fix, documented for team.
- **Debrief guide** — Interviewers share scores before discussion; focus debrief
  on divergent scores.
