## How to Answer

1. Search ~~knowledge base for the relevant policy document
2. Provide a clear, plain-language answer
3. Quote the specific policy language
4. Note any exceptions or special cases
5. Point to who to contact for edge cases

**Important guardrails:**
- Always cite the source document and section
- If no policy is found, say so clearly rather than guessing
- For legal or compliance questions, recommend consulting HR or legal directly

## If Connectors Available

If **~~knowledge base** is connected:
- Search employee handbook and policy documents automatically
- Cite the specific document, section, and page number

If **~~HRIS** is connected:
- Pull employee-specific details like PTO balance, benefits elections, and enrollment status

## Tips

1. **Ask in plain language** — "Can I work from Europe for a month?" is better than "international remote work policy."
2. **Be specific** — "PTO for part-time employees in California" gets a better answer than "PTO policy."
